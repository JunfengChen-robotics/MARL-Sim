# MultiRoboLearn
<!-- omit in toc -->
 
**This is an unified framework which can by used by researcher multi-agent reinforcement learning in robot learning for multi-robot system.**

``MultiRoboLearn`` build an open-source framework for multi-robot systems. This framework builds a unified setup of simulation and real-world applications. It aims to provide standard, easy-to-use simulated scenarios that can also be easily deployed to real-world multi-robot environments. Also, the framework provides researchers with a benchmark system for comparing the performance of different reinforcement learning algorithms.

# Main Features
- It mainly focus on multi-robot system. It provides the community with an open-source framework for MADRL simulations and their corresponding deployment on real robots. 
- It can be used in continous and discrete action space
- It herits [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) interface for all the the environments, easily matching different kinds of algorithms
- It has been successfully deployed to train two kinds of MADRL algorithms to solve two different tasks in simulation as well as real-world tasks without any further training in  the real world
