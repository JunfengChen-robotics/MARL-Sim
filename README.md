# MultiRoboLearn
<!-- omit in toc -->
 
**This is an unified framework which can by used by researcher multi-agent reinforcement learning in robot learning for multi-robot system.**

``MultiRoboLearn`` build an open-source framework for multi-robot systems. This framework builds a unified setup of simulation and real-world applications. It aims to provide standard, easy-to-use simulated scenarios that can also be easily deployed to real-world multi-robot environments. Also, the framework provides researchers with a benchmark system for comparing the performance of different reinforcement learning algorithms.
